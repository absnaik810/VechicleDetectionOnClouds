Vehicle detection using Haar Cascades on Clouds.
=================================================================

The Project is about the deployement of Vehicle Detection on multiple Chameleon clouds
using the Ansible playbook. Vehicle Detection Application uses haar-cascade cars.xml, 
a pre-trained classifier from openCV library which is a trained classifier with 526 rear-end images 
of cars. The Application is deployed on Chameleon cloud with the help of Cloudmesh client, 
which is a cloud VM management tool.
